                    <p>Motivated career-changer excited to make the jump from civil to software engineering. By adding technical programming knowledge to established management and communication skills, I intend to become a well-rounded, self-directed software developer. Passionate for web development by its accessibility and ease of use for the user, I enjoy writing code that can reach users across the world with just one "push".</p>
                    <p>I have completed more than 20 projects in my six years as a project manager in construction. I understand the importance of pre-planning in the project life-cycle and can incorporate that into developing software products. Understanding your customer (the user) leads to a successful project (product). By collaborating with customers throughout the build process, I ensure expectations and outcomes are aligned.</p>
                    <p>I hope to bring this user-based approach to a like-minded software development company that promotes a sustainable work culture. Check out my GitHub (contact info) and completed course certificates below.</p>
